        <h2>Tech Pack Creation</h2>
        <p>Knee-high socks require careful documentation to ensure consistent sizing and stay-up performance. We prepare comprehensive tech packs that include detailed size charts with calf/knee measurements, rib tension specifications, length targets (to prevent twisting), reinforcement zone details, care protocols, and complete packaging requirements. Our documentation is validated against industry standards so every pair fits as intended and stays in place through daily wear.</p>

        <h2>Sampling</h2>
        <p>Fit and length confirmation samples arrive within 7�10 days. Our samples are evaluated for calf fit (not too tight or loose), knee coverage, stay-up rib performance, and overall length consistency. We verify sizing across your full range so there are no surprises when bulk shipments arrive. Adjustments to rib tension or length are made quickly with revised samples at no additional charge.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p>Knee-high socks balance fashion with function. Our manufacturing process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yarn Blending:</strong> Cotton for breathability, polyester for durability, and spandex for sustained stretch through wear and washing.</li>
            <li><strong>Graduated Knit Density:</strong> Calf and knee areas receive lighter knits for comfort; heel and toe zones are reinforced for durability.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineered Rib Cuffs:</strong> Top rib is tuned to stay in place without cutting off circulation�a critical balance for all-day comfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Length Precision:</strong> Each size is knit to exact length specifications; boarding and heat-setting lock in length to prevent post-wash stretching or shrinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforced Heel/Toe:</strong> Extra yarn passes create cushioning and durability in high-wear areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Linking & Seaming:</strong> Flat seams minimize pressure points on shins and calves.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape-Locking Boarding:</strong> Heat treatment prevents twisting and maintains consistent shape through repeated washes.</li>
            <li><strong>Final QC:</strong> 100% pair-matching, length verification, rib tension checks, and visual inspection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Quality knee-highs demand quality materials. We source premium cotton, durable polyester, and high-recovery elastane�all validated for comfort and longevity. Elastic rib yarns are selected specifically for stay-up performance and comfort. Labels, size stickers, and packaging are sourced with compliance and traceability, ensuring your knee-high program aligns with brand standards and student or customer expectations.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Flexible Order Options</h2>
        <p>Standard MOQ is 400 pairs per color, reflecting knit setup and boarding time. School uniform programs and bulk fashion retailers often consolidate across multiple colors or seasonal assortments; we'll work with you to structure orders that meet your needs and optimize per-unit costs.</p>

<h2>Price Transparency</h2>
<p>Our FOB range of $0.70 - $1.05 per pair covers yarn sourcing, knitting, linking, boarding, finishing, QC, and packing.</p>

<h2>Production Time</h2>
<p>Bulk production runs 25-35 days including knitting/finishing, QC, and packing. Expedited slots are available for seasonal drops and replenishments.</p>

<h2>Custom Labeling & Amazon FBA Ready Packaging</h2>
        <p>Full private label execution includes size labels, UPC/ASIN stickers, branded belly bands, polybags with appropriate warnings, and carton labels pre-configured for FBA or school supply distribution. We handle all logistics so your knee-highs arrive ready to sell or distribute.</p>
