    <p>In 2026, supply chains are transparent but choosing the wrong factory can still stall your brand. Spot the warning signs early, confirm the green lights, and vet your partner before you pay a deposit.</p>
  </section>

  <article class="blog-body">
        <p>Your manufacturer is the engine of your business—if the engine fails, the whole brand stalls. Whether you source in Bangladesh or elsewhere, reliability is about proof, not promises. Look past slick sit's and cheap quotes to how a partner communicates, certifies, and controls quality.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The red flags: when to walk away</h2>
            <h3>1) Lack of verifiable certifications</h3>
            <p>If a factory claims to be ethical or sustainable but cannot produce valid BSCI, Sedex, or OEKO-TEX certificates, be cautious. These are baseline standards in 2026.</p>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Without proof of compliance, you risk labor violations, shipment delays, and being blacklisted by major retailers or Amazon.</p>

            <h3>2) Poor communication or slow responses</h3>
            <p>Communication is the heartbeat of production. If it takes a week to answer a basic fabric or shipping question during the honeymoon phase, expect slower responses once your deposit clears.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Prioritize partners who offer a dedicated account manager and transparent timelines for updates.</p>

            <h3>3) “Yes to everything” syndrome</h3>
            <p>If you ask for silk suiting, heavy denim, and complex activewear and the answer is an instant “yes,” you may be talking to a middleman, not a factory.</p>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> No single factory is world-class at every category. A reliable partner knows their strengths and tells you what they cannot do we'll.</p>

            <h3>4) No formal quality control (QC) process</h3>
            <p>Ask: “What is your AQL?” If they cannot explain Acceptable Quality Limit'standards or their internal inspection steps, expect inconsistent sizing, loose threads, or mislabeling.</p>

            <h2>The green lights: signs of a great partner</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency in sourcing:</strong> They can name their mills, trims, and dye houses, and share lab dips and swatches.</li>
                <li><strong>Proactive problem-solving:</strong> They suggest alternatives—“This fabric may shrink; choose pre-shrunk cotton” or “Let's reinforce seams for this fit.”</li>
                <li><strong>Willingness to start small:</strong> They offer low MOQs (100–300 unit's) to validate demand and grow with you instead of insisting on one big order.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to vet a manufacturer (the checklist)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Request a live video tour:</strong> In 2026 there's no excuse—ask to see the production line, sample room, and packing area. If they refuse, rethink the relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Order a paid sample:</strong> Treat it as a test drive. Inspect stitching, labels, finishing, and packaging against your tech pack.</li>
                <li><strong>Check references:</strong> Request 2–3 current brands. Ask those brands about lead-time accuracy, defect rates, and communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify logistics knowledge:</strong> Ensure they understand Amazon FBA prep, carton labeling, HS codes, and your country's import duties.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Bottom line</h2>
