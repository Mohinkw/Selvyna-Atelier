        <h2>Tech Pack Creation</h2>
        <p>Compression socks require precision documentation. We detail compression mapping by zone (ankle, mid-foot, calf), mmHg targets for each size, size charts with fit tolerances, yarn specifications, wash/care protocols, and complete packaging requirements. Our tech packs ensure that compression levels are consistent across every pair and persist through the garment's lifespan?critical for medical, athletic, and we'llness applications.</p>

        <h2>Sampling</h2>
        <p>Fit and compression validation samples arrive in 10?12 days. We offer wear testing and pressure-gauge verification to confirm your mmHg targets are achieved. Our samples include sizing across the full range so you can validate fit without surprises in bulk production. Adjustments to compression zones or yarn blends are negotiated quickly with iterative samples.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p>Compression socks combine technical precision with therapeutic benefit. Our manufacturing process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Yarn Selection:</strong> High-quality nylon and premium spandex blends engineered for sustained compression without loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Fine-Gauge Knitting:</strong> Specialized machines create graduated compression, with higher density at the ankle, tapering toward the calf for optimal blood circulation support.</li>
            <li><strong>Mapped Zones:</strong> Each sock has defined compression zones?ankle (highest), arch, and calf?tuned to deliver therapeutic benefit without discomfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforced Toe & Heel:</strong> Flat-seam construction and extra reinforcement prevent blistering and pressure points during extended wear.</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure Testing:</strong> Every batch undergoes pressure-gauge testing to confirm mmHg ranges per size; data is logged for your records.</li>
            <li><strong>Boarding for Retention:</strong> Heat-boarding locks compression into the fiber structure so it resists degradation through multiple washes and wears.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Certification:</strong> QA reports with photos, compression measurements, and size verification before shipment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Therapeutic-grade compression demands high-quality materials. We source premium nylon and spandex yarns from trusted mills, alongside elastic threads, reinforced toe/heel yarns, and compliant packaging. Our supply chain is fully transparent?each component is tracked and certified for compliance, supporting claims of therapeutic benefit and quality assurance.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Flexible Order Options</h2>
        <p>Standard MOQ is 400 pairs per color, reflecting the setup time for compression calibration and testing protocols. For established partners or high-volume programs, we can negotiate lower minimums or consolidate across colorways to reach your targets.</p>

<h2>Price Transparency</h2>
<p>Our FOB range of $1.05 - $1.75 per pair includes premium yarn sourcing, fine-gauge knitting, pressure testing, finishing, QC certification, and packing. Upgrades like copper yarns are quoted as needed.</p>

<h2>Production Time</h2>
<p>Bulk production runs 30-40 days including knitting/finishing, QC, and packing. Expedited slots are available for seasonal drops and replenishments.</p>

<h2>Custom Labeling & Amazon FBA Ready Packaging</h2>
        <p>Full private label execution includes size-coded bands (critical for compression verification), care labels highlighting mmHg levels, UPC/ASIN stickers, polybags with therapeutic claim compliance, and carton labels configured for FBA or retail distribution. We ensure all packaging clearly communicates compression level and therapeutic use.</p>

        <h2>Selvyna Atelier Advantage</h2>
