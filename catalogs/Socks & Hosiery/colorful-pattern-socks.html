        <h2>Tech Pack Creation</h2>
        <p>Graphic socks demand precision art direction. We prepare detailed tech packs that include artwork placement specifications, knit gauge targets, repeat patterns, colorway definitions (PMS targets or actual material samples), size charts, care instructions, and packaging mockups. Our documentation ensures that every design element?from motif placement to heel-to-toe color alignment?is executed consistently across bulk production runs.</p>

        <h2>Sampling</h2>
        <p>Strike-off samples and fit'samples arrive within 8?12 days, showing your design in actual knit form with color accuracy checked against PMS targets. We can iterate quickly: if the stripe thickness needs adjustment, the color needs tweaking, or the motif placement needs realignment, we'll turn around revised samples within days. Our approach ensures you approve a sample you're thrilled to ship to customers.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p>Colorful pattern socks combine technical knitting with creative design. Our process includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design Preparation:</strong> We collaborate on artwork file setup, ensuring knit-compatible separations for jacquard or intarsia knitting.</li>
            <li><strong>Yarn Selection:</strong> Colorfast cotton, polyester, and elastane blends that hold vibrant hues through multiple washes without fading.</li>
            <li><strong>Jacquard/Intarsia Knitting:</strong> Specialized machines create complex pattern weaves in real time; each color yarn is fed precisely to build intricate designs without compromising structural integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Print Alternative:</strong> For simpler patterns, direct printing onto pre-knit'socks offers cost advantages and faster turnarounds than intarsia.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforced Comfort Zones:</strong> Heel and toe receive extra passes and arch support yarn for durability and comfort despite elaborate patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Colorfast Processing:</strong> Proprietary dye fixation and washing ensure colors remain vibrant and aligned across repeated wears.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Verification:</strong> AQL inspections check color matching against PMS/samples, motif clarity, seam strength, and stretch retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Pattern perfection starts with sourcing. We source colorfast cotton, durable polyester, and high-recovery elastane in a palette of hues. Specialized print inks (when using print-on-knit methods), dyes for jacquard, labels, hangtags, and packaging are sourced with full traceability and compliance. Our supply chain partners understand the demands of graphic hosiery and deliver consistent materials run after run.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Flexible Order Options</h2>
        <p>Standard MOQ is 400 pairs per design. This minimum reflects knit'setup time and dye/print preparation. If you're launching a new seasonal collection with multiple patterns, we can consolidate across designs to achieve better unit economics or negotiate special pricing for established partners.</p>

<h2>Price Transparency</h2>
<p>Our FOB range of $0.63 - $0.98 per pair includes yarn sourcing, jacquard/intarsia knitting or printing, finishing, QC, and packing.</p>

<h2>Production Time</h2>
<p>Bulk production runs 25-35 days including knitting/finishing, QC, and packing. Expedited slots are available for seasonal drops and replenishments.</p>

<h2>Custom Labeling & Amazon FBA Ready Packaging</h2>
        <p>Full private label execution includes custom belly bands showcasing your design, branded hangtags, barcode/ASIN labels, polybags with legal warnings, and carton labels configured for FBA inbound logistics. Your brand story is front-and-center at every stage, from warehouse to customer's drawer.</p>
