        <h2>Tech Pack Creation</h2>
        <p>Detailed specs: yarn count, knit density, size gradings, care, packaging, and carton data to avoid production errors and keep handfeel consistent.</p>

        <h2>Sampling</h2>
        <p>Handfeel and fit'samples in 10-12 days with chosen yarn blends to validate warmth, softness, and shrink control. We test multiple yarn ratios (merino/acrylic, cashmere blend, alpaca blend) and boarding intensities to ensure the sock meets luxury and performance expectations. Strike-offs include dyeing trials and boarding samples to verify shrink behavior and final texture.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p><strong>Yarn Selection & Blending:</strong> We source premium wool varieties (merino, cashmere, alpaca blends) combined with acrylic and spandex for warmth without itch, durability, and easy care. Yarns are inspected for color consistency, strength, and elasticity before knitting.</p>
        <p><strong>Knitting & Reinforcement:</strong> Advanced knitting machines create precise knit densities for thermal regulation. Toe and heel reinforcement uses nylon or polyester for durability. Rib cuffs are engineered for gentle compression and reliable stay-up fit without cutting off circulation.</p>
        <p><strong>Boarding & Heat Setting:</strong> Steam-based boarding stabilizes shape, reduces shrink, and improves handfeel. Heat-setting locks in dimensions for consistent sizing across the production run. Boarding intensity is customized per yarn blend to preserve wool softness while achieving dimensional stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality Inspections:</strong> AQL Level 2 inspections check for pilling (pillow tested at wear points), colorfastness (wash/light testing), seam strength, and handfeel consistency. Every pair is checked for correct fiber composition and weight.</p>

        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Premium wool/acrylic/spandex yarns and blends sourced from certified mills with traceability for fiber origins. Labels and packaging materials comply with environmental and labor standards. Optional sustainable fibers (recycled polyester, organic cotton labels) available for eco-conscious brands. All suppliers audited for compliance and ethical labor practices.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Flexible Order Options</h2>
        <p>Standard MOQ: 400 pairs per color to balance yarn bulk purchases with inventory optimization. For gift market strategies or seasonal colorways, we accommodate smaller initial runs with full production at higher volumes. Volume pricing unlocks at 5000+ pairs per color, ideal for wholesale and retail floor programs.</p>

<h2>Price Transparency</h2>
<p>Our FOB range of $0.84 - $1.26 per pair covers wool-acrylic yarns, knitting, linking, boarding, finishing, QC, and packing. Premium yarn specs or specialty dyes are quoted separately.</p>

<h2>Production Time</h2>
<p>Bulk production runs 25-35 days including knitting/finishing, QC, and packing. Expedited slots are available for seasonal drops and replenishments.</p>

<h2>Custom Labeling & Amazon FBA Ready Packaging</h2>
        <p>Hang tags, belly bands, branded polybags with washing/care instructions, and barcode/ASIN labeling for seamless FBA integration. Custom labeling includes care symbols for wool blends, shrink guidance, and fiber composition claims. Gift-ready packaging options: tissue wrap, branded boxes, and holiday-specific designs available without MOQ minimums on labels.</p>
