    <p>Nearly 90% of fashion startups fail within their first year. The reason? it's rarely about the designs not being good enough. it's almost always avoidable mistakes in supply chain, budgeting, and brand positioning.</p>
  </section>

  <article class="blog-body">
    <h2>Why Most Fashion Startups Fail in Year 1</h2>
    <p>The fashion industry is notoriously competitive. While many entrepreneurs launch with beautiful sketches and high energy, the data is brutal: nearly 90% of fashion startups fail within their first year. The tragic irony? These failures have nothing to do with design quality.</p>
    <p>Instead, failures stem from avoidable mistakes in three areas: supply chain execution, financial planning, and brand positioning. If you're building a private label or Amazon FBA brand in 2026, understanding these pitfalls will put you in the 10% that succeed.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #1: Skipping the Tech Pack (The Costly Guesswork)</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-section">
      <h3>The Mistake</h3>
      <p>Sending a reference photo from Instagram to a manufacturer and asking, "Can you make this?" without a professional Tech Pack. This seems like a shortcut, but it costs thousands in revision cycles.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why It Fails</h3>
    <p>Without a detailed tech pack, the factory guesses your measurements, fabric weight, and stitching details. This leads to expensive sample loops: Sample 1 has sleeves 2 inches too long. Sample 2 has off-center buttons. Sample 3 is the wrong blue. Each sample costs $80–$200 and takes 2–3 weeks. Five iterations = $400–$1,000 wasted, plus 8–10 weeks of timeline burned.</p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>Invest in a production-ready tech pack before contacting any factory. At Selvyna Atelier, we create:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Sketches (Flats):</strong> 2D drawings showing every seam, stitch type, and detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Bill of Materials (BOM):</strong> Every button, thread, zipper, label, and trim itemized with specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Graded Spec Sheets:</strong> Measurements for all sizes (XS–XL) to ensure consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Points of Measurement:</strong> Diagrams showing QC inspectors exactly where to measure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A proper tech pack eliminates sample loops and cuts your timeline from 8 weeks to 4 weeks.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #2: Ignoring "Landed Cost" in Pricing</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-section">
      <h3>The Mistake</h3>
      <p>A garment costs $8 to make at the factory. You think: "$8 × 3 = $24 retail. That's a solid 200% markup!" Then you'realize you're losing money on every sale.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why It Fails</h3>
    <p>Manufacturing cost is only the beginning. You also pay for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ocean freight ($0.80–$1.50 per kg)</li>
      <li>Import duties (16–20% tariff)</li>
      <li>Customs clearance ($200–$500 per shipment)</li>
      <li>Amazon FBA fees ($2.40–$4.50 per unit)</li>
      <li>Amazon referral fees (15% of sale price)</li>
      <li>Packaging, marketing, returns processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your $8 manufacturing cost easily becomes $18–$20 all-in landed cost. A $24 retail price = $4–$6 profit per unit (17–25% margin). One freight spike or return rate bump, and you're negative.</p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>Calculate your True Landed Cost: Unit Cost + Freight + Duties + Insurance + Packaging + Marketing. Maintain a 20% profit margin buffer to absorb shipping rate fluctuations. This typically requires a 4–5× multiplier on factory cost, not 3×:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory Cost: $8.00</li>
      <li>Retail Price: $32–$40 (4–5× markup)</li>
      <li>Your profit after all costs: $12–$18 per unit (30–45% margin)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mistake #3: Over-Complicating Your First Collection (SKU Bloat)</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-section">
      <h3>The Mistake</h3>
      <p>Launching with 15 styles, each in 5 sizes and 4 colors = 300 SKUs. At 100 unit's per style, that's 1,500 garments and $12,000–$15,000 in inventory. All your capital is tied up immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why It Fails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Capital lock-up prevents marketing, unexpected costs, and scaling winners.</li>
      <li>Dead stock risk: if one style doesn't sell, that capital is gone forever.</li>
      <li>More SKUs = more things to quality-check and manage. Mistakes multiply.</li>
      <li>Amazon FBA storage fees ($0.87/unit monthly for slow-moving items) destroy margins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>Start lean with 2–3 "Hero Products"—styles that solve specific customer pain points. Launch with 6–9 SKUs total (3 styles in 2–3 colorways each). Invest only $1,000–$1,500 to test the market without bankruptcy risk.</p>
    <p>After your first month on Amazon, reorder ONLY bestselling colorways. Discontinue slow sellers. Use profit's to expand incrementally.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #4: Underestimating Lead Times and Seasonality</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-section">
      <h3>The Mistake</h3>
      <p>Launching a summer collection in July. By the time it arrives (end of June after customs), it's July. Customers are already shopping for fall sweaters. Dead stock.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why It Fails</h3>
    <p>Fashion manufacturing in Bangladesh operates on a 6-month lead time from concept to market. This isn't negotiable—it's the reality of international supply chains.</p>

    <h3>The Solution: Follow the 6-Month Lead Time Rule</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Design & Tech Pack development</li>
      <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Sampling & fit adjustments; lock PP sample</li>
      <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Bulk production run in Bangladesh</li>
      <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> Quality control & final packaging with Amazon barcodes</li>
      <li><strong>Month 5:</strong> Sea freight (30–40 days) + customs clearance</li>
      <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> Amazon listing setup & marketing launch</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Timeline Example:</strong> To launch a summer collection in June, start design in January. To launch for back-to-school in August, start in March. Build these timelines into your business plan and communicate them with your factory partner.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #5: Focusing on "Aesthetic" Over "Audience"</h2>
    
    <div class="mistake-section">
      <h3>The Mistake</h3>
      <p>Designing what you personally love: trendy silhouettes, experimental colors, avant-garde details. You launch expecting customers to appreciate your artistic vision. The collection sit's unsold.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why It Fails</h3>
    <p>Personal taste and market demand are rarely aligned. Your Instagram feed may feature experimental fashion, but Amazon customers search for solutions: "How do I find a black v-neck tee that won't pill?" or "Where's a dress that fit's busty women properly?"</p>
    <p>Your job is not to impose your aesthetic on the market. it's to identify customer pain points and solve them better than competitors.</p>

    <h3>The Solution: Mine 1-Star Reviews for Gold</h3>
    <p>Find competitors on Amazon and read their 1-star and 3-star reviews. Ignore 5-star reviews (they don't tell you what's wrong). Focus on complaints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Fabric is way too thin. I can see through it."</li>
      <li>"Sizing is completely inconsistent between sizes."</li>
      <li>"Seams are loose. Came apart after one wash."</li>
      <li>"Fit's small even though measurements say otherwise."</li>
      <li>"No pockets, which is frustrating for this price."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Build your brand as the solution to these exact problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thin fabric complaint? Use 200+ GSM premium cotton (opaque, durable).</li>
      <li>Sizing inconsistency? Invest in graded fit model with tight tolerances (±0.25").</li>
      <li>Loose seams? Highlight seaming quality, thread type, and durability testing.</li>
      <li>No pockets? Your dress includes functional, lined pockets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A dress designed to solve "see-through fabric" will outsell an artistically experimental dress 10:1 on Amazon.</p>

    <h2>The Difference Between 90% Failure and 10% Success</h2>
    <p>Winners get these five things right:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Professional tech packs</strong> that eliminate sample loops and timeline waste</li>
      <li><strong>Accurate landed cost calculations</strong> with 20% profit margin buffers</li>
      <li><strong>Lean SKU strategy</strong> that preserves capital for scaling</li>
      <li><strong>6-month planning calendars</strong> that align with seasonal demand</li>
      <li><strong>Customer-centric design</strong> that solves real pain points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The common thread: preparation. Winners plan before they manufacture. They understand costs before they price. They validate demand before they design 300 SKUs.</p>
    <p>None of this happens in a vacuum. You need a manufacturing partner who understands startup constraints and can deliver low-MOQ production, fast sampling, technical support, Amazon-ready logistics, and transparent communication.</p>
