        <h2>Tech Pack Creation</h2>
        <p>Athletic crew socks demand precision engineering. We develop detailed tech packs covering yarn specifications, knit density targets, precise sizing grids with fit allowances, compression zone mapping (especially if you're adding arch support), wash/care requirements, and complete packaging specifications. Our documentation ensures that every batch?from proto through full-scale production?meets your performance benchmarks.</p>

        <h2>Sampling</h2>
        <p>Proto and pre-production samples arrive within 7?10 days, ready for wear testing. We evaluate stretch recovery, cushioning consistency, arch support effectiveness, color stability, and packaging alignment with your brand vision. Our iterative approach means you can request adjustments?thicker cushioning, different arch heights, or revised sizing?and receive updated samples quickly without additional charges.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p>Athletic crew socks combine performance with comfort, requiring specialized manufacturing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premium Yarns:</strong> We select combed cotton for breathability, polyester for durability, and elastane for consistent stretch and recovery through intense activity and repeated washing.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Knitting:</strong> Multi-gauge circular knitting machines create reinforced heel/toe zones and engineered arch compression areas that stay in place during movement.</li>
            ><li><strong>Moisture Management:</strong> Strategic yarn placement maximizes moisture-wicking to keep feet dry during workouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision Linking:</strong> Seamless or flat-seam linking minimizes friction points, reducing blistering and improving comfort during high-impact activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape-Setting:</strong> Boarding and heat-setting lock in performance features and ensure size stability across the full size run.</li>
            <li><strong>Colorfast Dyeing:</strong> Vibrant, long-lasting colors that wit'stand athletic wear and frequent laundering; AQL checks verify shrinkage, pilling, and seam integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Final QC:</strong> 100% pair-matching, dimensional verification, and visual inspection before packing and shipping.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Athletic performance starts with sourcing. We partner with mills that supply premium combed cotton, high-tenacity polyester, and performance-grade elastane. Our supply chain is fully transparent?every material component is tracked from mill to finished good. We also source specialized cushioning yarns, labels, UPC components, and FBA-compliant packaging with the same rigor, ensuring your athletic socks live up to your brand promise.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Flexible Order Options</h2>
        <p>Standard MOQ is 400 pairs per color, reflecting the knit'setup time for athletic specifications. However, we work with brands launching new colorways or testing market response?we can consolidate orders across multiple styles to reach minimum volumes or negotiate special runs for established partners with consistent volume.</p>

<h2>Price Transparency</h2>
<p>Our FOB range of $0.56 - $0.84 per pair covers yarn sourcing, knitting, cushioning, boarding, QC, and packing. Volume tiers improve further for larger runs.</p>

<h2>Production Time</h2>
<p>Bulk production runs 25-35 days including knitting/finishing, QC, and packing. Expedited slots are available for seasonal drops and replenishments.</p>

<h2>Custom Labeling & Amazon FBA Ready Packaging</h2>
        <p>Full private label execution includes your branded labels, UPC/ASIN stickers, size tabs, hang tags, retail-ready polybags with suffocation warnings, and carton labels pre-configured for FBA inbound shipments. We handle all logistics labeling so your products are ready to go from our warehouse to Amazon or your retail distribution center.</p>
