        <h2>Tech Pack Creation</h2>
        <p>We develop comprehensive tech packs that ensure every pair of ankle socks meets exact specifications. Our documentation includes stitch density parameters, rib height measurements, complete size charts with tolerances, care code requirements, and detailed packaging specs. We work with your brand guidelines to ensure production consistency, from initial proto through to full bulk runs. Our tech pack reviews flag potential issues early and reduce waste, saving you time and money in the approval cycle.</p>

        <h2>Sampling</h2>
        <p>Proto and pre-production samples arrive in 7-10 days so you can evaluate stretch recovery, cuff durability, color accuracy, and label/packaging placements before committing to bulk. We offer iterative sampling�if tweaks are needed to fit, handfeel, or sizing, we'll turn around refined samples quickly. Our sampling process includes wash and wear testing to validate durability and colorfastness under real conditions.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p>Ankle socks demand precise engineering to deliver comfort and durability at scale. Here's how we manufacture:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yarn Selection:</strong> We use only combed cotton for superior softness and consistency, blended with polyester for durability and elastane for stretch retention through multiple washes.</li>
            <li><strong>Knitting:</strong> Circular knitting machines calibrated for tight, even weaves; reinforced heel and toe zones receive extra passes to prevent premature wear.</li>
            <li><strong>Elastic Rib Cuffs:</strong> Engineered rib cuffs that stay in place without cutting off circulation, ensuring comfort for all-day wear.</li>
            <li><strong>Boarding & Sizing:</strong> Heat-boarding locks shape and prevents unraveling; each size is verified against your chart before proceeding.</li>
            <li><strong>Colorfast Dyeing:</strong> Proprietary dyeing processes ensure deep, even colors that withstand multiple washes; AQL checks on seams and stretch prevent defects.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Inspection:</strong> 100% pair-matching, length verification, and visual inspection before packing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Quality socks start with quality materials. We source combed cotton from certified suppliers, polyester for durability, and elastane for consistent stretch recovery. Our supply chain is transparent�we track every component and maintain relationships with mills that meet our stringent compliance standards. Labels, size tabs, and FBA-ready packaging are sourced with the same rigor, ensuring your brand identity is protected throughout production.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Flexible Order Options</h2>
        <p>Standard MOQ for ankle socks is 400 pairs per color, but we're flexible with launch strategies and replenishment cycles. If you're testing a new color or size mix, we can structure MOQs to suit your cash flow. Consolidating multiple colorways can also reduce per-unit costs, so we'll work with you to find the sweet spot.</p>

<h2>Price Transparency</h2>
<p>Our FOB pricing of $0.42 - $0.63 per pair breaks down cleanly: yarn sourcing, knitting labor, linking, boarding, dyeing, finishing, and packing. Volume discounts are available as you scale.</p>

<h2>Production Time</h2>
<p>Bulk production runs 25-35 days including knitting/finishing, QC, and packing. Expedited slots are available for seasonal drops and replenishments.</p>

<h2>Custom Labeling & Amazon FBA Ready Packaging</h2>
        <p>We handle full private label execution: branded labels, UPC/ASIN barcode stickers, size tabs, polybags with suffocation warnings, and carton labels that comply with FBA logistics. Your brand story stays front-and-center at every touchpoint�from warehouse to customer's closet.</p>

        <h2>Selvyna Atelier Advantage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fit Precision:</strong> Our size grading is validated against industry standards and customer feedback to minimize returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Pack Mastery:</strong> We optimize 2-packs, 3-packs, and 6-packs to reduce per-unit freight costs and accelerate shelf velocity.</li>
            <li><strong>On-Floor QC:</strong> Our team catches knitting and linking defects in real time, preventing bad batches from shipping.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Partnerships:</strong> We're available for mid-production questions and final tweaks, treating your success as our success.</li>
        </ul>
