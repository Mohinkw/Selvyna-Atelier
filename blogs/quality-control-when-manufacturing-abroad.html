    <p>Manufacturing overseas offers cost savings and scale, but without proper quality control, you risk defective inventory, angry customers, and destroyed margins. Here's how to implement QC checkpoints at every stage—from fabric inspection to pre-shipment audit's.</p>
  </section>

  <article class="blog-body">
    <p>You've designed your line, negotiated pricing, and placed your first order with an overseas manufacturer. Then your shipment arrives—and 20% of the unit's have crooked seams, mismatched colors, or wrong sizes. You scramble to issue refunds, tank your Amazon ranking, and lose thousands in unsellable inventory. This scenario is preventable with structured quality control. In this guide, we'll break down the QC process, inspection types, acceptable defect rates, and how to enforce accountability with your manufacturer.</p>

    <h2>Why quality control matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defect costs:</strong> A $5 defective tee costs you $5 COGS + $10 shipping + $15 lost sale + customer trust. One bad batch can wipe out a quarter's profit.</li>
      <li><strong>Return rates:</strong> Poor quality drives 15–25% return rates (vs 5–10% for we'll-made goods). Each return costs $8–15.</li>
      <li><strong>Review damage:</strong> One "terrible quality" review with photos scares off 10–20 potential buyers.</li>
      <li><strong>Amazon penalties:</strong> High defect rates trigger ASIN suppression or account suspension.</li>
      <li><strong>Retailer chargebacks:</strong> Nordstrom, Target, and other retailers charge penalties for defective shipments—often 10–20% of order value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The 4 stages of quality control</h2>
    <p>Effective QC happens at multiple checkpoints—not just when goods arrive at your door.</p>

    <h3>1) Pre-production QC (before bulk manufacturing)</h3>
    <p>Catch issues before thousands of unit's are made.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fabric inspection:</strong> Check fabric rolls for defects (holes, stains, dye streaks) using a 4-point system. Reject rolls with &gt;40 points per 100 yards.</li>
      <li><strong>Lab dip approval:</strong> Factory sends dyed fabric swatch for color approval. Compare to Pantone or approved sample under natural light. Approve or request re-dye.</li>
      <li><strong>Strike-off approval (prints):</strong> For printed fabrics, approve the first print run sample before bulk production.</li>
      <li><strong>Trim and accessories check:</strong> Inspect zippers, buttons, elastic, labels before they're sewn in. Check color, size, branding accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-production sample (PP sample):</strong> Factory makes 1–2 unit's using approved fabric and trims. This is your final green light before bulk. Check fit, construction, labels, packaging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Inline QC (during production)</h3>
    <p>Monitor production while it's happening to catch systemic issues early.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First article inspection:</strong> Check the first 5–10 completed unit's off the line. Verify measurements, stitching, label placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Cutting inspection:</strong> Ensure fabric is cut accurately per pattern specs. Miscuts cause fit issues across the entire batch.</li>
      <li><strong>Sewing line checks:</strong> Inspect 10% of unit's at random during production. Look for skipped stitches, uneven seams, tension issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Measurement audit's:</strong> Randomly pull 3–5 unit's and measure against tech pack specs (bust, length, inseam). Tolerance: +/- 0.5–1 cm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Pre-shipment QC (final inspection before shipping)</h3>
    <p>This is your last line of defense before goods leave the factory.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AQL inspection (Acceptable Quality Limit):</strong> Industry standard is AQL 2.5 (2.5% major defects acceptable). Third-party inspectors check a statistically significan't sample (e.g., 80 unit's from a 1,000-unit order).</li>
      <li><strong>What inspectors check:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Measurements (tolerance +/- 1 cm)</li>
          <li>Stitching (skipped stitches, uneven seams, loose threads)</li>
          <li>Fabric defects (holes, stains, pilling)</li>
          <li>Color consistency (compare to approved sample)</li>
          <li>Labels and branding (correct placement, spelling, barcodes)</li>
          <li>Packaging (polybags sealed, hang tags attached, carton labeling)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pass/fail criteria:</strong> If defects exceed AQL 2.5 for major defects or 4.0 for minor defects, reject the shipment and request rework.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4) Post-delivery QC (after goods arrive)</h3>
    <p>Even with pre-shipment inspection, check a sample when inventory arrives.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Receiving inspection:</strong> Open 3–5 random cartons and inspect 10–20 unit's for defects, damage, or missing items.</li>
      <li><strong>Wash test:</strong> Wash 2–3 unit's per style to check for shrinkage, color bleed, or fabric distortion. (Do this before listing on Amazon to avoid surprises.)</li>
      <li><strong>Customer feedback loop:</strong> Track return reasons and reviews. If "loose threads" or "color off" come up repeatedly, tighten QC on next order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Defect classification: Critical, major, minor</h2>
    <p>Not all defects are equal. Classify them to set clear expectations with your manufacturer.</p>

    <h3>Critical defects (0% acceptable)</h3>
    <p>These make the garment unwearable or unsafe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Broken zippers or snaps</li>
      <li>Holes or tears</li>
      <li>Wrong size labels</li>
      <li>Missing labels or care instructions</li>
      <li>Chemical odor or stains</li>
      <li>Sharp objects (needles left in garment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major defects (AQL 2.5 = 2.5% acceptable)</h3>
    <p>These affect function or appearance significan'tly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skipped stitches (&gt;1 inch)</li>
      <li>Uneven seams or puckering</li>
      <li>Misaligned prints or patterns</li>
      <li>Color shading (visible difference between panels)</li>
      <li>Fabric defects (visible snags, pulls, dye spots)</li>
      <li>Incorrect measurements (outside +/- 1 cm tolerance)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Minor defects (AQL 4.0 = 4% acceptable)</h3>
    <p>These are cosmetic and don't affect wearability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loose threads (&lt;1 inch)</li>
      <li>Slight puckering at seams (not visible when worn)</li>
      <li>Small variation in stitching (within 1–2mm)</li>
      <li>Packaging imperfections (wrinkled polybag, slightly tilted hang tag)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to hire a third-party QC inspector</h2>
    <p>On-ground inspectors are your eyes and ears in the factory. Expect to pay $200–400 per inspection.</p>

    <h3>Top QC companies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intertek (intertek.com):</strong> Global leader; rigorous standards; premium pricing.</li>
      <li><strong>SGS (sgs.com):</strong> Largest inspection network; reliable for apparel.</li>
      <li><strong>Bureau Verit's (bureauverit's.com):</strong> Strong in Bangladesh and China; mid-tier pricing.</li>
      <li><strong>AsiaInspection / QIMA (qima.com):</strong> Tech-enabled platform; book online; detailed photo reports.</li>
      <li><strong>V-Trust (v-trust.com):</strong> Budget-friendly; good for startups; Bangladesh-focused.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to include in your inspection request</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order details:</strong> PO number, quantity, style names/SKUs</li>
      <li><strong>AQL level:</strong> AQL 2.5 for major defects, 4.0 for minor (industry standard)</li>
      <li><strong>Approved sample:</strong> Ship your golden sample to the inspector as the reference standard</li>
      <li><strong>Measurement spec sheet:</strong> List all critical measurements (bust, length, inseam) with tolerances</li>
      <li><strong>Defect checklist:</strong> Prioritize your top concerns (e.g., "Check pocket depth," "Verify logo placement")</li>
      <li><strong>Packaging requirements:</strong> Polybag specs, hang tag placement, carton labeling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inspection timeline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Book 3–5 days before production ends:</strong> Inspectors schedule 2–3 days out; don't wait until the last minute.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspection day:</strong> Takes 4–8 hours depending on order size.</li>
      <li><strong>Report delivery:</strong> You'll receive a photo-heavy PDF report within 24 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Decision time:</strong> Review report and decide: approve shipment, request rework, or reject.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DIY QC: What to check yourself (if you can't afford inspectors)</h2>
    <p>If you're bootstrapping and can't pay $300/inspection, use these remote QC tactics.</p>

    <h3>1) Request factory photos and videos</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>During production:</strong> Ask for photos of cutting, sewing, and finished unit's every 2–3 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-shipment:</strong> Request video walk-through of finished goods (flat-lay + close-ups of seams, labels, packaging).</li>
      <li><strong>Measurement verification:</strong> Ask factory to measure and photograph 3 random unit's with a measuring tape visible in the frame.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Ship a sample batch via courier</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $40–80 for DHL/FedEx to ship 2–3 unit's from Bangladesh.</li>
      <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Arrives in 3–5 days; you inspect locally before approving bulk shipment.</li>
      <li><strong>What to check:</strong> Wash test, try on, measure, photograph defects if any.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Use a local QC agent</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hire a freelancer:</strong> Platforms like Upwork or Fiverr have QC agents in Bangladesh/China who charge $50–150 for a basic inspection.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Quality varies; less reliable than established firms like SGS or Intertek.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to handle QC failures</h2>
    <p>If your pre-shipment inspection fails, you have three options.</p>

    <h3>Option 1: Rework (most common)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Factory fixes defects (re-stitch seams, replace labels, remove stains).</li>
      <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3–7 days for rework + re-inspection.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Usually free if defects are factory's fault. You pay for re-inspection ($200–300).</li>
      <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Defects are fixable (loose threads, wrong labels, minor stitching).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Option 2: Partial acceptance + discount</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Negotiate a discount on defective unit's; sell as B-stock or outlet.</li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> 10% of unit's have minor stitching issues → request 15% discount on those unit's.</li>
      <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Defects are minor, and you need inventory fast (e.g., holiday season).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Option 3: Reject shipment (nuclear option)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Refuse shipment and request full remake or refund.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost:</strong> You lose time (4–6 weeks for remake). Factory may fight refund.</li>
      <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Critical defects (unwearable goods, wrong sizes, major color mismatch) and factory refuses rework.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal protection:</strong> Use Alibaba Trade Assurance or PayPal Goods & Services to enforce refunds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating a quality control agreement</h2>
    <p>Add a QC clause to your purchase order or manufacturing contract.</p>

    <h3>Sample QC clause</h3>
    <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #6e0a1e; padding-left:12px; color:#555; margin:16px 0;">
      <p><em>"Seller agrees to maintain quality standards per AQL 2.5 for major defects and AQL 4.0 for minor defects. Buyer reserves the right to conduct third-party inspection before shipment. If defect rate exceeds AQL standards, Seller will rework defective unit's at no cost or issue a pro-rata refund. Buyer will not accept shipment until QC inspection is passed. Critical defects (broken zippers, holes, wrong labels) are 100% unacceptable and will result in full shipment rejection."</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Long-term QC strategies</h2>
    <h3>1) Build a relationship with a reliable factory</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality improves with repeat orders. Factories learn your standards and prioritize consistent partners.</li>
      <li>Visit the factory in person (or hire a local agent to do so) after 2–3 orders to build trust and rapport.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Create a detailed QC manual</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Document your standards: measurement tolerances, acceptable stitch density (12–14 stitches per inch), label placement photos, packaging specs.</li>
      <li>Share with factory and inspector so everyone's aligned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Incentivize quality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Offer a 2–5% bonus payment if the factory passes inspection with &lt;1% defect rate.</li>
      <li>Penalize failures: 5–10% holdback on payment until QC passes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4) Track defect trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain a spreadsheet: Order # | Defect Type | % Defective | Root Cause | Corrective Action</li>
      <li>If "skipped stitches" recur, it's a machine or training issue—address it directly with factory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>QC checklist for every order</h2>
    <p>Use this as your pre-flight checklist before approving shipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>☐ Lab dip approved (color matches Pantone/sample)</li>
      <li>☐ Pre-production sample approved (fit, construction, labels)</li>
      <li>☐ Inline QC photos reviewed (cutting, sewing, first articles)</li>
      <li>☐ Third-party inspection scheduled and passed</li>
      <li>☐ Measurements verified (within +/- 1 cm tolerance)</li>
      <li>☐ Labels correct (brand name, size, care, country of origin)</li>
      <li>☐ Packaging meets spec (polybags, hang tags, carton labels)</li>
      <li>☐ Sample unit's shipped via courier for wash test (if budget allows)</li>
      <li>☐ Payment released only after QC approval</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common QC mistakes startups make</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Skipping pre-production samples:</strong> "We approved the tech pack, we're good." No—always test a physical PP sample.</li>
      <li><strong>Trusting factory self-inspection:</strong> Factories are incentivized to ship on time, not to catch defects. Hire independent inspectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspecting after goods arrive:</strong> By then it's too late. Inspect before shipment leaves the factory.</li>
      <li><strong>No tolerance specs:</strong> "Make it like the sample" is vague. Define +/- 1 cm measurement tolerance.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring minor defects:</strong> 100 unit's with loose threads = 30 minutes of hand-trimming or 10% of customers noticing in photos and leaving bad reviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Selvyna Atelier handles quality control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-ground team in Dhaka:</strong> Our QC managers visit factories during production for inline checks (no extra cost to you).</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-production approvals:</strong> We send you lab dips, strike-offs, and PP samples before bulk production starts.</li>
      <li><strong>AQL 2.5 standard:</strong> We conduct pre-shipment inspections on every order using third-party auditors or our internal QC team.</li>
      <li><strong>Photo reports:</strong> you'receive detailed photo documentation (measurements, close-ups, packaging) before shipment.</li>
      <li><strong>Rework guarantee:</strong> If defects exceed AQL limit's due to factory error, we manage rework at no cost to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-delivery support:</strong> If issues arise after delivery, we work with the factory to resolve (discounts, remakes, or credit's toward next order).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bottom line</h2>
    <p>Quality control isn't optional—it's the difference between profit and disaster. Implement QC at four stages: pre-production (fabric and samples), inline (during sewing), pre-shipment (final inspection), and post-delivery (receiving check). Hire third-party inspectors for orders over $3,000, and always approve pre-production samples before bulk. Define defect standards (AQL 2.5), document them in your PO, and enforce accountability. Good QC protects your margins, your reputation, and your customers—and it's worth every dollar spent.</p>
