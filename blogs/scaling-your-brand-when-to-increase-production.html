    <p>Know when to scale up, when to slow down, and how to grow without drowning in inventory or cash flow problems. Here's a data-driven framework for expanding production, launching new products, and building a sustainable fashion business.</p>
  </section>

  <article class="blog-body">
    <p>You've launched your brand, validated product-market fit, and sold through your first few production runs. Now you're ready to scale. But scaling too fast kills brands—you overstock slow sellers, run out of cash, and lose control of quality. Scaling too slowly costs opportunity—you miss peak seasons, lose momentum, and let competitors steal market share. This guide breaks down when to scale, how much to scale, and what metrics to track to grow profitably.</p>

    <h2>Signals you're ready to scale</h2>
    <p>don't scale based on gut feeling or FOMO. Look for these concrete indicators:</p>

    <h3>1) Consistent sellthrough (60–80%+ within 60 days)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it means:</strong> you're selling 60–80% of each production batch within 2 months of launch.</li>
      <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Proves demand is real and repeatable, not just a one-time spike.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> If 3+ consecutive production runs hit 70%+ sellthrough, it's time to increase order quantities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Frequent stockouts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it means:</strong> you're selling out of popular sizes (usually M/L) or colors before the next shipment arrives.</li>
      <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Lost sales = lost revenue. If you're out of stock 30%+ of the time, you're leaving money on the table.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Increase production by 25–50% and build a 4–6 week inventory buffer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Positive unit economics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it means:</strong> you're profitable on a per-unit basis after all costs (COGS, shipping, ads, fulfillment, overhead).</li>
      <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Unit Profit = Retail Price - COGS - Shipping - Ad Cost - Fulfillment - (Overhead / Unit's Sold)</li>
      <li><strong>Benchmark:</strong> Aim for 20–30% net margin per unit. If you're break-even or negative, fix unit economics before scaling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4) Repeat customer rate (20–30%+)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it means:</strong> 20–30% of customers return to buy again within 90 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Scaling with one-time buyers means you're constantly chasing new customers (expensive). Repeat customers = profitable growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> If repeat rate is &lt;15%, focus on retention (email, loyalty programs, product quality) before scaling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5) Cash flow allows it</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it means:</strong> You have enough cash to pay for production (30–50% deposit + balance) without risking payroll, rent, or other obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> don't tie up more than 30–40% of your cash in inventory at once.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> If cash is tight, scale gradually (20–30% increase per order) or use financing (see below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How much to scale: The 25–50% rule</h2>
    <p>Avoid doubling or tripling production overnight. Scale incrementally to manage risk and learn what works.</p>

    <h3>Scaling framework by stage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First reorder (validation):</strong> If your first batch was 200 unit's and you sold 75%+, order 250–300 unit's (25–50% increase).</li>
      <li><strong>Orders 2–4 (momentum):</strong> Increase 30–50% per order if sellthrough stays strong. Example: 300 → 400 → 550 → 750 unit's.</li>
      <li><strong>Orders 5+ (maturity):</strong> Once you hit 1,000+ unit's per order, slow growth to 15–25% per order to avoid overstock.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inventory planning formula</h3>
    <p>Use this formula to calculate your next order size:</p>
    <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #6e0a1e; padding-left:12px; color:#555; margin:16px 0;">
      <p><strong>Order Quantity = (Average Monthly Sales × Lead Time in Months) + Safety Stock</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Average Monthly Sales:</strong> Last 3 months' sales divided by 3</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Time:</strong> Production + shipping time (usually 2–3 months for overseas manufacturing)</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Stock:</strong> 1–2 months' buffer to cover stockouts</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You sell 150 leggings/month. Lead time is 2.5 months. Safety stock = 1 month.<br>
    Order Quantity = (150 × 2.5) + 150 = 525 unit's</p>

    <h2>What to scale: Products vs SKUs</h2>
    <p>don't scale everything equally. Focus on winners and cut losers.</p>

    <h3>The 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reality:</strong> 20% of your SKUs drive 80% of revenue.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Identify your top 3–5 bestsellers (by unit's sold and revenue). Scale those aggressively. Reduce or discontinue the bottom 20%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SKU rationalization exercise</h3>
    <p>Rank every SKU by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Revenue contribution:</strong> Total sales in last 90 days</li>
      <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Net profit per unit</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory turnover:</strong> How fast it'sells (sales / average inventory)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Decision matrix:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High revenue + High margin:</strong> Scale up 50%+</li>
      <li><strong>High revenue + Low margin:</strong> Renegotiate COGS or raise price; scale cautiously</li>
      <li><strong>Low revenue + High margin:</strong> Niche product; maintain but don't scale</li>
      <li><strong>Low revenue + Low margin:</strong> Discontinue or liquidate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to expand your product line</h2>
    <p>Adding new styles is tempting, but timing matters.</p>

    <h3>Green light signals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3+ proven bestsellers:</strong> You have a core lineup that sells consistently.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer requests:</strong> 20+ customers ask for a specific product (e.g., "Do you make matching shorts?").</li>
      <li><strong>High repeat rate (30%+):</strong> Loyal customers are ready to buy more from you.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash flow allows testing:</strong> You can afford 100–200 unit's of a new style without risking core inventory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Red light signals (don't expand yet)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inconsistent sales:</strong> Some months you sell 200 unit's, others 50. Fix demand generation first.</li>
      <li><strong>High return rate (15%+):</strong> Product quality or fit issues will follow you to new styles.</li>
      <li><strong>Low repeat rate (&lt;15%):</strong> Focus on retention before adding SKUs.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash flow stress:</strong> If you're bootstrapping and barely covering orders, don't add complexity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to test new products</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Order 100–200 unit's (minimum MOQ) of 1–2 new styles.</li>
      <li><strong>Leverage existing customers:</strong> Launch new styles to email list first; gauge pre-orders or early sales.</li>
      <li><strong>A/B test:</strong> Run a small ad campaign for the new style vs a bestseller. Compare conversion rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Set a 60-day sellthrough target:</strong> New styles should hit 60–70% sellthrough in 60 days. If not, don't reorder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scaling channels: DTC, Amazon, Wholesale, Retail</h2>
    <p>As you grow, diversify sales channels—but sequence them strategically.</p>

    <h3>Stage 1: DTC-only (Months 1–6)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Shopify store + Instagram/Facebook ads</li>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Highest margins (no marketplace fees), direct customer feedback, full brand control</li>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Prove product-market fit and build a customer base of 500–1,000 buyers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stage 2: Add Amazon FBA (Months 6–12)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Massive reach (300M+ Prime members), fast growth, built-in fulfillment</li>
      <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Proven DTC sales + 4+ star product reviews</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory split:</strong> 60% DTC, 40% Amazon initially; adjust based on velocity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stage 3: Wholesale/Boutiques (Year 1–2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Bulk orders (50–200 unit's per retailer), brand credibility, offline presence</li>
      <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> 50% wholesale margin built into pricing (retailer buys at 50% of MSRP)</li>
      <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Lower margins but predictable bulk orders</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stage 4: Retail partnerships (Year 2+)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Nordstrom, Anthropologie, Target</li>
      <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> $500K–1M annual revenue, proven sales velocity, ethical compliance audit's</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Scale to 10K–50K unit's per order; national exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financing options for scaling</h2>
    <p>If you don't have cash to fund larger orders, explore these options:</p>

    <h3>1) Revenue-based financing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Borrow $10K–500K, repay as a % of monthly revenue (e.g., 10%) until you've repaid 1.3–1.5x the loan.</li>
      <li><strong>Providers:</strong> Clearco, Shopify Capital, Kickfurther</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No equity given up; repayment scales with revenue</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (30–50% effective APR); requires proven revenue</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Inventory financing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Lender pays your manufacturer directly; you'repay loan when inventory sells.</li>
      <li><strong>Providers:</strong> Kickfurther, Settle, Wayflyer</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Aligns repayment with inventory turnover</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> 3–8% fee per order; requires purchase orders and sales history</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Purchase order financing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Lender pays manufacturer based on confirmed PO from a retailer (e.g., Target order for 5,000 unit's).</li>
      <li><strong>Providers:</strong> BlueVine, Fundbox, traditional factors</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Unlocks large wholesale orders</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires confirmed PO from creditworthy buyer; 2–5% fee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4) Small business loans</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Traditional term loan from bank or SBA (Small Business Administration).</li>
      <li><strong>Amount:</strong> $5K–500K</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Lower interest (6–12% APR); fixed repayment schedule</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires good credit (680+) and financials; slow approval (weeks to months)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5) Crowdfunding (Kickstarter, Indiegogo)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Pre-sell products to fund production; deliver after manufacturing.</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No debt or equity; validates demand</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> 5–10% platform fees; requires strong marketing; delivery risk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operational scaling: Hiring and delegation</h2>
    <p>As you scale, you can't do everything yourself. Here's when to hire.</p>

    <h3>$10K–50K/month revenue: Founder + freelancers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Founder handles:</strong> Product development, supplier relationships, strategy</li>
      <li><strong>Outsource:</strong> Customer service (VA for $8–15/hr), social media ($300–800/mo), bookkeeping ($150–400/mo)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>$50K–150K/month: First full-time hires</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hire 1:</strong> Operations Manager (handles production, logistics, QC, inventory) — $50K–70K/year</li>
      <li><strong>Hire 2:</strong> Marketing Manager or contractor (ads, email, content) — $40K–60K/year or $1,500–3K/mo freelance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>$150K–500K/month: Build a team</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ops team:</strong> Ops Manager + Logistics Coordinator + CS Rep</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing team:</strong> Marketing Manager + Content Creator + Paid Ads Specialist</li>
      <li><strong>Founder role:</strong> Shift to strategy, fundraising, partnerships, product vision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scaling mistakes to avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scaling too fast:</strong> Doubling production without validating demand = dead inventory and cash flow crunch.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring unit economics:</strong> "we'll make it up in volume" rarely works. Fix margins before scaling.</li>
      <li><strong>Adding too many SKUs:</strong> 20 SKUs with shallow inventory is worse than 5 SKUs with deep stock.</li>
      <li><strong>Overreliance on one channel:</strong> 100% Amazon = vulnerable to algorithm changes or account suspension. Diversify.</li>
      <li><strong>Neglecting quality as you grow:</strong> Larger orders = more QC risk. Maintain inline and pre-shipment inspections.</li>
      <li><strong>Underfunding growth:</strong> Scaling requires cash. don't starve inventory to pay for ads—plan for both.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Metrics to track as you scale</h2>
    <p>Dashboard these KPIs weekly or monthly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Revenue growth rate:</strong> Month-over-month % increase</li>
      <li><strong>Gross margin:</strong> (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue; target 50–70% for DTC, 40–55% for Amazon</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):</strong> Total ad spend / new customers; should be &lt;30% of LTV</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):</strong> Average order value × repeat purchase rate × average lifespan (months); aim for LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1+</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory turnover:</strong> COGS / Average Inventory; target 4–6x per year (every 2–3 months)</li>
      <li><strong>Sellthrough rate:</strong> Unit's sold / unit's produced; target 70–85% within 60–90 days</li>
      <li><strong>Cash conversion cycle:</strong> Days from paying manufacturer to collecting customer payment; aim to minimize (60–90 days typical)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Selvyna Atelier supports scaling brands</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flexible MOQs:</strong> Start with 100–300 unit's; scale to 1,000+ per style as you grow—no rigid minimums.</li>
      <li><strong>Faster reorder timelines:</strong> Once patterns are approved, reorders ship in 4–6 weeks (vs 8–12 for new styles).</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory planning support:</strong> We help you forecast order quantities based on sales data and lead times.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-channel prep:</strong> We can split'shipments (e.g., 60% to your warehouse, 40% to Amazon FBA) and prep per channel requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Financing referrals:</strong> We connect growing brands with inventory financing partners (Kickfurther, Clearco) to fund larger orders.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality consistency:</strong> Our QC processes scale with you—same standards whether you order 200 or 2,000 unit's.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bottom line</h2>
    <p>Scale when the data says you're ready: consistent sellthrough, positive unit economics, repeat customers, and cash flow to support growth. Increase production incrementally (25–50% per order), focus on bestsellers, and test new products in small batches. Diversify sales channels as you mature—DTC first, then Amazon, then wholesale. Track your KPIs religiously and avoid the trap of scaling too fast without infrastructure. Growth is exciting, but profitable, sustainable growth is the goal. Move fast, but don't break your business.</p>
